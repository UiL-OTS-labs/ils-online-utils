# ils-online-utils

A small set of utilities that can be reused for online experiments

## Introduction

In the ils lab we are have moved some of the research online, due to limitations
in inter human contact imposed on us due to the Covid Pandamic. We use the
jsPsych library: https://www.jspsych.org/ for our online experiments; jsPsych
offers functions to run an experiment and present stimuli to a participant
using a web capable device. This library intends to add some small utility
functions that can be used throughout multiple experiments. Although, the ILS
uses jspsych for online experiments in theory it should be possible to use this
utilities with any experiment platform in an online setting.
